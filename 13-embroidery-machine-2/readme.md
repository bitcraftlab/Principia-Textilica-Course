### [Knitting Voices](http://doku.trikoton.com/) ###

The Trikoton project received a major German startup award.   
It started out as a Processing sketch and a hacked Brother Knitting Machine.
The basic idea is mass customization of personalized knitwear based on sound samples provided by the clients.
