## Pen and Paper Weaving Patterns

*This is a pen and paper exercise:*

1. Get two square sheets of thick paper (20cm x 20cm)
2. Cut each Square into 20 paper strips 
3. Create a woven structure, using both colors in warp and weft.

Can you create an emergent pattern? 
Have a look at the [HoundsTooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houndstooth) for a popular example.


## A Braiding Font

*This is a Processing Exercise:*

1. Sketch a braid on raster paper
2. Identify structural units, and turn them into glyphs 
3. Use Processing to generate a braiding font, and print out a representation of a braid given as a [BraidWord](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BraidWord.html).


## Computational Braiding

*This is a Mathematica Exercise:*

1. Create an integer sequence using numbers from 1 .. 5 and use it as cord flip-sequence to create 5-ply Braids (See the braiding demo!)
2. Write some functions:
  *  A function to change the braiding sequence so the resulting braid is the vertical mirror image of the original braid, 
  *  A function to change the braiding sequence so the resulting braid is the horizontal mirror image of the original braid
  *  A function to join braids together
3. Use those functions to create a complex braid.

Also: 

Try to find out more about Mathematicas **KnotData** function.
- What kind of knot data does it provide?
- How can you the data in a format, that you can use in Processing?
