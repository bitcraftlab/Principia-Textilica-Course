# Notation Systems II

## Working with Functions

In the 1st part of this lecture we will learn to use *Mathematica* for:

- drawing threads and braids
- modify the drawing style
- using functions to modify the drawing style
- using anonymous functions a.k.a. pure functions

## Working with Processing

In the 2nd part of this lecture we will learn to use *Processing* for:

- working with 2 dimensional arrays
- declaring classes, attributes and methods
- creating and using objects

## Braiding Notation

We will have a look at Braids, and how their structure can be represented.
We will touch on topics of

- fundamental braiding units and operations
- Knot theory and braid theory
- Braiding notations

# Exercises

The exercises can be found [here](exercises).

**Note:**
If you want to submit your Mathematica code to Version control it is generally a good idea to save your work as **Mathematica Packages** rather than Notebooks.

# Demos

In this lecture I demonstrated how to create braids with *Mathematica*.
