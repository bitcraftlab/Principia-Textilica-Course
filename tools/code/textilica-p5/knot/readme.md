Knotting with *Processing*
===========================

## Things to Try

We will be working with *Mathematical Knots*.
Unlike everyday knots they are made from a single closed loop.


### Picking the Knots

* Play with the knot sketch to create a selection of knots
* Look them up online to learn more about their properties


### Linking the Loop

* Pick a material of your choice
* If you are working with fibers, find a way to splice two ends together
* Create a collection of knots
* Think of a beautiful and systematic way to showcase them
* Photograph and document your results
