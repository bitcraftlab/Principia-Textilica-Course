Textile Automata II
==================

## Fractal Curves ##

We already got to know L-Systems and fractal curves.
Today we are going into more detail about space filling curves.

There are three simple ways to generate space filling curves

1. Recursive Drawing
2. Rewriting-Systems
3. Arithmetic Approach


## Demos ##

You can find the demos [here](demos).
