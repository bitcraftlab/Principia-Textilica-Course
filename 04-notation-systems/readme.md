# Notation Systems 

## Working with Expressions

In the 1st part of this lecture we will learn to use *Mathematica* for:

- taking expressions apart
- modifying expressions

Check out the [introduction to expressions](../tools/lang/mathematica-expressions).

## Working with Sequences

In the 2nd part of this lecture we will learn to use *Mathematica* for:

- taking sequences apart
- modifying sequences

Check out the [introduction to sequences](../tools/lang/mathematica-sequences).

## Generating Fonts

In the 3rd part of this lecture we will learn to use *Processing* & *Fontastic* to:

- generate fonts
- use the fonts to create custom notations
